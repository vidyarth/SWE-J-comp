# ONLINE TUITION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

### INTRODUCTION
```
  Most students in their schooling goes to tuition centers in order to
  understand concepts better than what is taught in the schools. Students also
  go to tuition centers inorder to prepare for the entrance examinations like
  JEE, NEET and so on. But most of these tuition centers are not managed
  properly. Most of the tuitions are managed using Whatsapp groups and
  Telegram groups. But these applications do not suffice all the needs that a
  tuition center needs and a students needs to manage properly. The Online
  Tuition Management system fills these gaps by creating separate logins for
  admin of the tuition center, student login, staffs login and parent login.
